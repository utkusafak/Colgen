Simultaneous lot sizing and scheduling problem solution algorithm.

Algorithm uses column generation based search heuristics. Algorithm is designed for the cases where secondary resources, sequence dependent setups and setup carryover/crossover decisions are critical. Solved problem is a case of parallel sets of nonidentical macines.

The datasets are in .txt format. The datasets include below information:
